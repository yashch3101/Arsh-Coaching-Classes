                <h3>What is Physics?</h3>
                <p>Physics is the branch of science concerned with the study of matter, energy, and the fundamental forces that govern the interactions between them. It seeks to understand the natural laws and principles that underlie the behavior of the universe, from the smallest particles to the largest structures.

                    Key areas of physics include:
                    
                    Classical Mechanics: This branch deals with the motion of objects and the forces acting upon them. Classical mechanics, as formulated by Isaac Newton, describes the motion of everyday objects under the influence of gravity, friction, and other forces.
                    Thermodynamics: Thermodynamics explores the relationships between heat, energy, and work. It provides fundamental principles governing the behavior of gases, liquids, and solids, and it underlies many engineering applications, such as engines, refrigeration, and phase transitions.
                    Electromagnetism: Electromagnetism studies the interactions between electrically charged particles and the electromagnetic field. It encompasses topics such as electric and magnetic fields, electromagnetic waves, and the behavior of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields.
                    Quantum Mechanics: Quantum mechanics describes the behavior of particles at the smallest scales, such as atoms, subatomic particles, and photons. It introduces concepts like wave-particle duality, quantization of energy, and probability amplitudes, challenging classical notions of determinism and causality.
                    Relativity: Relativity, as formulated by Albert Einstein, revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. It consists of two main theories: special relativity, which deals with the behavior of objects moving at high speeds, and general relativity, which describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy.
                    Particle Physics: Particle physics explores the fundamental constituents of matter and the forces that govern their interactions. It involves the study of subatomic particles such as quarks, leptons, and bosons, as well as the fundamental forces: electromagnetism, weak nuclear force, strong nuclear force, and gravity.</p>
